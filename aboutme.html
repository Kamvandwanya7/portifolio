            <p class="paragraph">I, Kamva Ndwanya was born in a small town called Cofimvaba in Eastern
                Cape. I completed my matric in 2014, then
                relocated to another small town named Alice(eDikeni) to enrol for my undergraduate studies in
                Agricultural
                Economics(BSc) and graduated in 2019.

                I previously worked as a Customer Service Advisor for 2 years, I enjoyed helping people and the
                enthusiasm
                of
                getting the "thank you so much, God bless you" from helping someone, giving them the best customer
                service.
                I am currently learning how to build and style websites from scratch and it is exciting..</p>
